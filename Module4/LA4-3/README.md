# Learning Activity 4-3: The Template MyMax Function
In this activity we will develop a template max function that finds the
maximum value in an array. Then we will 
call the function using ints, doubles, and Carton objects. 

There are videos that demonstrate how to create and use the max template 
function that works with arrays. It is recommended that you write the code 
as you follow along with the video.

We will be writing code in the main.cpp, max_array.h, carton.h and carton.cpp files. 
These files can be found in the src folder.

#### How to compile and run the code. 

It is recommended that you do this often.

For Windows:
```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles"
$ cmake --build .
# Now you can run your code
$ .\bin\ca.exe
```
For Linux/Mac:
```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ cmake --build .
# Now you can run your code
$ ./bin/ca
```
