# Learning Activity 4-1: The Template Swap Function
In this activity we will develop a template swap function. Then we will 
call the function using ints, doubles, and Carton objects.

There are videos that demonstrate how to create and use the swap template 
function. It is recommended that you write the code as you follow along with 
the video.

We will be writing code in the main.cpp and the swap.h files. We will also be
using the carton.h and carton .cpp files. These files can 
be found in the src folder.

#### How to compile and run the code. 

It is recommended that you do this often.

For Windows:
```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles"
$ cmake --build .
# Now you can run your code
$ .\bin\ca.exe
```
For Linux/Mac:
```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ cmake --build .
# Now you can run your code
$ ./bin/ca
```
