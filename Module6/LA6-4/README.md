# Learning Activity 6-4: Using Pointers With Objects
There are times when we want to dynamically allocate objects. When we use
a pointer to an object the syntax is a little different. In this activity
we will learn how to access member functionality with a pointer to 
an object.

There are videos that introduce this topic. It is recommended that you write 
the code as you follow along with the video.

We will be writing code in the main.cpp file.

#### How to compile and run the code. 

It is recommended that you do this often.

For Windows:
```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles"
$ cmake --build .
# Now you can run your code
$ .\bin\ca.exe
```
For Linux/Mac:
```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ cmake --build .
# Now you can run your code
$ ./bin/ca
```
