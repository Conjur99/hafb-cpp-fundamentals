# CS-1410-Getting-Started
## Challenge Activity 0.1 for CS 1410 Module 0

For this project you are to set up a C++ development environment, run code, and commit it to GitHub. 
This is to get your own environment up and ready for coding and compiling C++ code. 
We will be using this environment throughout this  course.

This will involve three specific components.

- C++ editor
- C++ compiler
- Git and GitHub 

Once you have the environment set up and working, 
use the starter code provided in hello.cpp. 

- [ ] Clone the CA 0.1 start code
- [ ] Compile and run the code. See that it prints out


  Hello!  
  Welcome to CS 1410!  



Once you have everything working,

- [ ] Take a screenshot of the code in your editor. Include the top bar 
so we can see what editor is being used.


- [ ] Take a screenshot of the output in the compiler. Include the commands 
for compiling and running the code.

- [ ] Commit your completed code to github.
- [ ] Upload the screenshot of the editor to GitHub.
- [ ] Upload the screenshot of the output to GitHub.

Once you are happy with how it is all working.

- [ ] Send a GitHub message to the instructor letting them know you are done.
