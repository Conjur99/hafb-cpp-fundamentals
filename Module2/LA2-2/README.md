# Learning Activity 2-2: Using the File I/O Classes to Read From a File
There are many classes that have been created and can be used in code. In this 
activity we use the ifstream class. This class will make it
possible to read from files.

There are videos that demonstrate how to define and use ifstream objects.
It is recommended that you write the code as you follow along with the video.

We will be writing code in the main.cpp file. It can be found in the src 
folder.

#### How to compile and run the code. 

It is recommended that you do this often.

For Windows:
```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles"
$ cmake --build .
# Now you can run your code
$ .\bin\ca.exe
```
For Linux/Mac:
```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ cmake --build .
# Now you can run your code
$ ./bin/ca
```
